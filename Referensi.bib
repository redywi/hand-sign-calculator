                  often stylized as LaTeX) is a software system for document
                  preparation.[2] When writing, the writer uses plain text as
                  opposed to the formatted text found in ``What You See Is What
                  You Get'' word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice
                  Writer and Apple Pages. The writer uses markup tagging
                  conventions to define the general structure of a document
                  (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text
                  throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add
                  citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as
                  TeX Live or MiKTeX is used to produce an output file (such as
                  PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution.",
